# Spam-Classification
Applying CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) to a binary classification in spam detection with text messages.

The dataset consists of 5,574 text messages in English. The data is designated as being ham or spam.

There are 4825 ham instances and  747 spam instances in the dataset.

In order to compare other traditional machine learning methods were implemented such as Decision Tree model, Multinomial Naive Bayes model and SVM model.

Results:
